# Alembic

We use the Alembic migration environment for managing database schema changes in this project.

## Usage

- **Create a new migration:**
  
  ```sh
  alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<migration message>"
  ```

- **Apply migrations:**
  
  ```sh
  alembic upgrade head
  ```

- **Downgrade migrations:**
  
  ```sh
  alembic downgrade <revision>
  ```

## Files

- `env.py`: Alembic environment configuration.
- `versions/`: Directory containing migration scripts.

## Notes

- Ensure your models are up to date before generating migrations.
- Review autogenerated migrations for correctness before applying.
- For more information, see the [Alembic documentation](https://alembic.sqlalchemy.org/en/latest/).
